webradio_player
===============

simple radio player, wrapper around mpv.

- [] add GUI and a better TUI
- [] use config file to read url list instead of hardcoding
- [] enable choice between mpv and not mpv:
  - [] switch to libffmeg or anything not primarily mpv
  - [] for mpv, switch to libmpv

NOTE
----

This is heavily broken and has many TODOs as it is a rewrite of a Bash
script I've used for years. Don't use this until I tag a release.
